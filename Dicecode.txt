rollfDefenceDice (maxDice) 
- check number of armies -> get maxDice
rollAttDice
- see rollDefenceDice

Example:
Attacker has and attacks with an army of 10.
Army of 10 maxDice -> 2 dice.

Defender defends with an army of 10.
Army of 10 maxDice -> 2 dice. 

Attacker throws 6,3 -> [6,3]

Defender throws 5,4 -> [5,4]

Sort by highest and check difference between attacker and defender.

Sort by highest: 

Attacker.sort(function(a, b){return b-a});
Defender..sort(function(a, b){return b-a});

Check difference:

for (var i = 0; i < defenderArray.length; i++;){
	if(attackerArray[i] > defenderArray[i])
	{
		return attacker;
	} else {
		return defender;
	}
